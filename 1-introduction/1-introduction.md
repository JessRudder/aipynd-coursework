# 1 - Welcome to AI Programming
Artificial Intelligence in use almost everywhere
Python
- Numpy: support for large data
- Pandas: Data analysis
- Matplotlib: Visualization
Neural Networks
- will be introduced
Deep learning
- will be focused on in class
* Apple's Siri / Amazon's Alexa
Will be able to build own deep learning algorithm from scratch by end of program
