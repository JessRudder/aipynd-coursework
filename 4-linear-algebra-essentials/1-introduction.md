# 1 - Our Goal
Not a complete Linear Algebra class
Goal is to give fundamental tools needed to train neural networks
Bonus: Show beautiful visual world of vectors and matrices

# 2 - Instructors
Grant Sanderson
  - creator of 3Blue1Brown (teaches math visually)
  - previously content creator at Khan Academy
Ortal
  - PhD in computer engineering
  - previously professor/research in field of applied cryptography embedded platforms
Jennifer Staab
  - PhD in computer science and masters in Biostatistics


# 3 - Essence of Linear Algebra
There are visual intuitions that, once you understand them, help you approximate linear algebra equations in your mind
  - specifically matrix math
Course provides intro
  - thinking you do on your own afterward is where the real learning happens

# 4 - Structure of This Lesson
Videos
  - intro linear algebra in beautifully visual way
Theory
  - text with elaborations on definitions and mathematical calculations
  - theoretical quizzes
Labs
  - implementations of theoretical concepts in code
Neural Netowrk Intro
  - final lesson pulling all pieces together to connect Linear Algebra to Neural Networks

# 5 - Working with Equations
You get a quiz at the end of each concept
  - may compare our derived equations with theirs
  - may check derived numerical values
Process
  - write equation in editing window (under math.txt)
  - this will be compared to correct equation giving immediate correct/incorrect result
  - Answers will be written in LaTeX
  - If you need to reset your data, use menu bar at bottom left of window

# 6 - Try Our Workspace Out!
Got to test out some latex:
`x^2-1=y`

# 7 - Try Our Workspace Again!
Some more practice, this time for matrices:
```
x_2=2

m_{12}=5

m_{21}=8
```

The first defines row 2, col 1

The second defines row 1, col 2

The third defines row 2, col 1
