# 1 - What's a Vector?
Physics
  - arrows pointing in space
  - 2 dimensonal
CS Student
  - ordered lists of numbers
  - vector is fancy word for list
Mathematician
  - anything where there is a sensible notion of adding to vecotrs and multiplying by a number

Think about an arrow inside a coordinate system

# 2 - Vectors, What Even are They? Part 2
Vector is pair of numbers that tells you how to get from origin (on grid line) to the tip of the arrow
  - write vertically with square brackets around the numbers
Every vector has 1 and only one set of numbers to describe it

# 3 - Vectors, What Even are They? Part 3
To add two vectors, move tail of second to tip of first then draw line from tail of first to tip of second, the resulting vector is the result of adding them
|1| + |3 | = |4|
|3|   |-1|   |2|

Match up terms and add each of them together

Multiplying or Scaling a vector
  - scalar is used interchangably with number

2 * |3| = |6|
    |1|   |2|

Multiply each part of vector by the scalar


# 4 - Vectors - Mathematical Definition
Definition: Ordered list of numbers
  - each element in vector (aka component/coordinate) is a number
Arrow is used to illustrate a vector

Calculate direction of movement using an angle (degrees or radians)


# 5 - Transpose
We've focused on column vectors (but they can be represented as rows too)
  - math symbol to transpose is T

# 6 - Magnitude and Direction
For magnitude of a 2D vector use Pythagorean Theorem
x = |4|
    |2|

||x|| = sqrt(4^2 + 2^2)

For direction of the movement, we need to use an angle
  - look at vector with respect to horizontal axis
  - 0 (theta) represents angle between that line and your 2D vector
  - 0 = tan^(-1 * (y/x)
  - 0 = tan^(-1 * (2/4)) = 26.56505 degrees

# 7 - Vectors: Quiz 1
Magnitude of 3 dimensional vector:
`\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}`

# 8 - Operations in the Field
Zero element: |0|
              |0|
              |0|
              |0|

One element:  |1|
              |1|
              |1|
              |1|            


We're going to focus on vector addition and scalar by vector multiplication

# 9 - Vector Addition

x = |a1|
    |a2|
    |a3|
    |a4|

y = |b1|
    |b2|
    |b3|
    |b4|

x+y = |a1 + b1|
      |a2 + b2|
      |a3 + b3|
      |a4 + b4|

# 10 - Vectors: Quiz 2
x = |5|
    |1|

y = |-4|
    |-1|

Magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2) = 1

Angle = 0 (it's on the X axis)

# 11 - Scalar by Vector Multiplication

For scalar, multiply each element in the vector by the scalar:

x = |a1|
    |a2|
    |a3|
    |a4|

y = zx = |za1|
         |za2|
         |za3|
         |za4|


# 12 - Vectors: Quiz 3
Magnitude of a vector with a scalar is 

`\alpha\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}`
(scalar * magnitude)

By knowing how to add vectors and how to multiply them by a scalar, we can define a very important term in Linear Algebra: Linear Combination.
